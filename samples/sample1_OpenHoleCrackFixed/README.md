# Sample 1: Calculating required load factor for a crack onset according to the coupled criterion

This sample shows how the code is able to calculate the load factor predicted by the coupled criterion of the finite fracture mechanics for a given crack geometry. The crack geometry is included as an input parameter, in this example as a segment, but it could be extended to other crack geometries.

## Usage

1. Copy FFMcracking.py from the src folder to the same folder where example1.py is located.
2. Edit example1.py, including the work directorty, computation directory, material properties, etc.
3. Run 'abaqus cae noGui=example1.py'
4. Once finished, the result should be in the output defined, screen, or abaqus.rpy file.
